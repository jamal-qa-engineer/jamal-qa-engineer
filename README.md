I am a QA Security Engineer focused on building secure, reliable, and high-quality software through automated testing, vulnerability analysis, and continuous security validation. With a background in QA, cloud fundamentals, and cybersecurity principles, I specialize in bridging the gap between development and security by designing test frameworks, identifying security risks early, and ensuring applications meet both functional and security requirements.I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.





## Objective

My objective is to showcase hands-on security-focused QA projects that demonstrate my ability to test, break, secure, and validate modern applications. This portfolio highlights my skills in automated testing, API security, static and dynamic analysis, secure coding validation, and cloud-based security workflows. I aim to contribute to teams that prioritize secure development practices and continuous improvement within the SDLC.
